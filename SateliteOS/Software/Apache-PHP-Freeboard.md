# Apache - PHP - Freeboard

The main interface uses Apache, PHP and Freeboard. The last one is an open source plataform the allows instalation of many widgets we use to collect, show and control the hardware (rocket).<br><br>
All softwares are very well documented in web and donÂ´t require more explanation. The plugins we use in Freeboard are available in <a href=./Freeboard>here</a>.

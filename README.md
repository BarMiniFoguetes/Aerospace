# Aerospace
Aerospace technology represents the most advanced technologies in the world. Some specific areas that TFX wants to develop are communications, propulsion, recovery, launch, monitoring and attitude control. To allow code reuse and online testing we are proposing an RPI Zero as the main platform running Python and PHP based scripts on Apache. It provides strong processing capabilities, integrated communication and many interfaces. It also improves development and allows extensive collaboration with developers on a single device simultaneously. The main software that supports all subsystems in RPI Zero, operating system (OS), we are calling <a href=./SateliteOS>SateliteOS<a>. The complete solution that runs Satelite OS should be a solid platform, the core hardware, that could drive the development of rockets, satellites and weather balloons. Offering all the sensors, communications with flexible hardware and software libraries to fulfill the basic functions of aerospace needs.
